# BEM Notes

`Block`: Think of this as the defining block or context of the component (E.g, Button, Card, Banner).

`Element`: This is a child element that is semantically tied to the block component (E.g, Button Icon, Card heading, Banner CTA).

`Modifier`: This is a flag you can put on a block or element to change its appearance while still inheriting styles from the root class (E.g, Button: Secondary, Tertiary, With Icon).
